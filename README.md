## Known Issues

- Page refresh will clear cookies due to Chrome's third-party cookie restrictions
  - AWSALB cookie lacks SameSite attribute
    ```
    This Set-Cookie header didn't specify a "SameSite" attribute and was defaulted to
    "SameSite=Lax," and was blocked because it came from a cross-site response which
    was not the response to a top-level navigation. The Set-Cookie had to have been
    set with "SameSite=None" to enable cross-site usage.
    ```
  - Browser Compatibility Issues:
    - Does not work on iOS mobile browsers
    - Does not work on Safari
